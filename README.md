## How to use:

1. Download SKYY on the [official website](http://skyy-ac.ml/) and Run SKYY
2. Generate a PIN/KEY Code in [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/n8Whk5A)
3. Put the PIN/KEY Code in SKYY
4. Wait the scan be finish
5. Check the scan results in SKYY Bot's DM

## Scan results:


* Suspicious Optifine Version

`The user is probably using a modified version of optifine`

* Suspicious Optifine Mod

`The user is probably using a modified mod of optifine`

* Hack in versions

`The user has a hacked version in the versions folder, In this example where this "hack" will be replaced by the hack name`


* Cheat detected

`The user is using a modification in minecraft, In this example where this "Cheat" will be replaced by the name of the hack`

## Benefits:

* Its remote:
`SKYY is 90% remote, The SS Owner has to generate a code and put it in the program of the user who is suspicious of cheating, And the scan results only go to the owner of the SS (Like Paladin.ac & Avenge.ac)`

* It's Free:
`SKYY is free, no one needs to pay to use SKYY ANTICHEAT (but if you are on the SKYY's blacklist you cannot use)`

* It's Fast:
`SKYY always tries to be as fast as possible for all computers and cases you have, SKYY BETA is having an average scan time of 1 to 5 seconds`

* It's Efficient:
`SKYY does not only use time-consuming methods of scanning memory strings, It uses others very effective and fast methods to detect cheats`

## F.A.Q:

**Q: Is SKYY a virus or do something malicious?**

**A:** No! SKYY Does **NOT** take any information from the user as much as the owner of the SS, The data on the scan is automatically **deleted** after the scan, **No** personal information is saved and SKYY does **NOT** require you to remain with him, You **can** close SKYY and **delete** it at **any** time!
 

**Q: SKYY Guarantees 100% non bypass methods and can i believe 100% only in SKYY?**

**A:** No! SKYY is in development and does **NOT** detect **100%** of all cheats, It is detecting some more common cheats, In the future SKYY detects MANY more cheats, But if the scan result says "User is legit", Do not trust only SKYY, Use other methods to detect cheats.


**Q: SKYY has detected a cheat on a user, Can it be a false positive?**

**A:** SKYY has a **99.9%** accuracy of detecting cheating, If SKYY has detected any cheating the user is most likely using some cheating, All methods are tested in different ways to not run false positives.

**Q: Can i say "SKYY was made by me" to other peoples?***

**A:** No! Never! If you like SKYY, know that it took a long time to do it and that I **(DeathZ)** dedicated a lot of time to it, Don't steal a project created by someone else and say that it is yours **PLEASE**!


**Q: Can I collaborate to create SKYY or report an error?**

**A:** If you want to collaborate with the creation of SKYY you unfortunately can only help by giving tips of methods for detections and report bugs/glitchs of SKYY, If you help me in any of these ways, I will be very grateful! ü§ç


**Q: Can I invite my friends to use SKYY or record a video about SKYY?**

**A:** Yes! If you invite your **friends** or record a **video**, I will be very **grateful** and you will be motivating me to continue to develop SKYY (And I'll leave a like in your video **:3**)

## Common errors:

**Invalid PIN:**
`This error is very common, and occurs when you type in some PIN/KEY code that does not exist or is invalid`


**An error occurred while scanning or SKYY doesn't open:**
`This error usually occurs when a program is interfering with SKYY and is not letting it scan the computer, See the list of processes and see if there is something malicious interfering, If not have, Download skyy again`


**Skyy could not be run, You need to be connected to the Internet to use Skyy:**
`The error is self explanatory, You need to be connected to the internet to use SKYY, If it is already, look in the list of processes and see if there are any processes that are interfering with SKYY, Probably a malicious program`


**A change in SKYY code  has been detected:**
`This error is not uncommon and occurs when the SKYY code is corrupted, if you downloaded SKYY and turned off the internet when you is downloading or running, this error can occur`
